    "- **while** loop: Use this when the number of iterations is unknown in advance, such as when processing a data stream or waiting for a condition to be met. The loop continues as long as the condition remains true. It is important to include a termination condition in a while loop to prevent it from running forever. This ensures the loop will eventually stop when the desired outcome is achieved."
